  By not providing "Findpak_hqp_controller.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "pak_hqp_controller", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "pak_hqp_controller" with any of the following names:

    pak_hqp_controllerConfig.cmake
    pak_hqp_controller-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "pak_hqp_controller" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "pak_hqp_controller_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "pak_hqp_controller" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
